Consulting Project Proposal
Client: Cherry Republic (Ann Arbor)
 Partner: University of Michigan – AI Business Group (ABG)
 Project: AI-Supported Scheduling & Customer Service Optimization

1. Project Background and Objective
Cherry Republic is a beloved Michigan brand known for its warm, fun, and personable approach to customer experience. With strong seasonal patterns in both retail and service center operations, leadership is looking to optimize staffing and customer service while ensuring that AI adoption feels authentic to the brand’s voice.
Cherry Republic currently leverages a chatbot (“Boomer”), but recognizes that this only scratches the surface of AI’s potential. The company seeks to build AI-supported tools that increase efficiency without sacrificing personality, warmth, or brand integrity.

2. Scope of Work
Core Project Focus (10 weeks)
Data Collection & Analysis
Analyze historical sales, traffic, and call volume by season.
Review staffing schedules, seasonal hiring patterns, and labor costs.
Map service center pain points (order tracking, billing corrections, call routing).


AI Modeling & Decision Tools
Build a lightweight AI-assisted model for seasonal staffing forecasts (stores + service center).
Create a manager-friendly decision flowchart for staffing during peaks and lulls.
Prototype an AI-assisted call support tool that maintains Cherry Republic’s warm and community-minded brand image 


Case Study Integration
Research how leading companies (e.g., Lemonade insurance, Warby Parker, Starbucks) integrate AI while keeping their brand “voice.”
Identify best practices Cherry Republic can adopt to ensure new or improved AI tools sound like “Cherry Republic,” not a generic system.


Implementation & Validation
Conduct manager/staff interviews to validate recommendations.
Pilot test flowcharts and call prototypes with managers.
Deliver refined tools and a roadmap for AI adoption.

Scope Expansion (Future Opportunities)
Chatbot Enhancement (“Boomer 2.0”): Expand from FAQ-only to include order tracking, personalized recommendations, and escalation triggers, all written in Cherry Republic’s signature voice.
Customer Recommendations Engine: Suggest “perfect pairings” of products in a playful way (e.g., “Our Cherry Salsa makes friends easily — just add Tortilla Chips!”).
Repeat Customer Engagement: AI-driven personalization in newsletters and emails, keeping the brand’s warm tone.
Marketing Automation: Features like “Shop Now” buttons in emails, paired with witty, Cherry-style copywriting.




3. Deliverables
Week 3: Initial findings report (staffing and call center analysis).
Week 5: Case study brief on how other companies maintain their “voice” in AI.
Week 6: Draft staffing flowchart + AI-assisted call support prototype.
Week 8: Revised guidelines and tools after staff feedback.
Week 10: Final project package, including:
Executive summary (2–3 pages).

Additional Partnerships Proposal
Partner: Cherry Republic
Proposed By: University of Michigan – AI Business Group (ABG)

1. Background
The AI Business Group (ABG) at Michigan Ross is the university’s leading student-run organization focused on exploring the business applications of artificial intelligence. Beyond our semester-long consulting engagements, ABG cultivates partnerships with organizations to create value through events, talent pipelines, and brand collaboration opportunities.

2. Partnership Opportunities
A. Conferences & Events
Conference Gift Bags: Cherry Republic products featured in ABG conference speaker gift bags, showcasing the brand to corporate leaders, academics, and AI professionals.
Raffle Basket: A Cherry Republic raffle basket offered at attendee giveaways, creating visibility and goodwill among ~100+ student and professional participants.
B. Project Team Engagement
Semesterly Socials: Each ABG consulting project team hosts a social event. The Cherry Republic project team would likely visit Cherry Republic’s Ann Arbor location during October–November, fostering brand connection and team engagement.
C. Internships & Talent Pipeline
Winter Staffing Partnership: Cherry Republic has a known staffing shortage during its busy Nov–Jan holiday season. ABG can support by connecting local Ann Arbor-based members as short-term customer service employees or interns.
Summer Internships: ABG offers a pipeline of top Ross and engineering students for summer internships. Options include:
Scope Expansion Project Internship: Analysts from the Cherry Republic project team continuing work in AI applications (chatbot, recommendations, marketing automation).
Virtual Internships: Opportunities for ABG analysts outside Ann Arbor to contribute remotely, providing flexibility and talent access.
In-Person Internships: If preferred, ABG can source Ann Arbor-based or Michigan-based students for on-site work.

3. Value for Cherry Republic
Brand Exposure: Cherry Republic products and story featured at ABG’s professional events.
Talent Access: Direct access to a vetted pipeline of students specializing in AI, business strategy, and operations.
Seasonal Staffing Support: Address the critical holiday staffing shortage with trained, motivated students.
Extended Impact Beyond Consulting: Maintain continuity with ABG project team members who already understand Cherry Republic’s business and AI journey.

4. Next Steps
We propose a conversation to determine which partnership opportunities best align with Cherry Republic’s goals for Fall 2025 and beyond.


these are our actual deliverables that we need to do and what I am working on: Develop an AI called Cherry voice that maintains the tone/personality of cherry republic (life liberty beaches and pie). This will respond to phone calls using FAQ's that customers typically ask and it should be able to tell customers who ask where there order is or how long it will take how long it will actually take. Another side to this is to set up a seasonal labor scheduler, using data that we will be provided to have an AI that can create labor shifts for people and make a schedule for different seasons, complying with the state of Michigan's labor law policies.
